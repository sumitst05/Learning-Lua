# ðŸš€ Learning Lua ðŸŒ™

Welcome to my journey of learning Lua! Lua is a powerful scripting language known for its simplicity, efficiency, and versatility. In this repository, I will document my progress and share my knowledge of Lua with you.

## ðŸ“– About Lua

Lua was first developed in 1993 by Roberto Ierusalimschy, Luiz Henrique de Figueiredo, and Waldemar Celes at the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It was designed to be a lightweight and embeddable scripting language for use in other applications.

Today, Lua is used in a wide variety of applications, including game development, web development, scientific computing, and more. Its simple syntax, powerful features, and small footprint make it an ideal choice for many programming tasks.
